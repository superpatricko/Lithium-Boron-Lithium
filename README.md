Setup
=======

The project has been setup assuming this file layout:


    workspace (or whatever you want to call it)
		.metadata                         # Eclipse workspace stuff
		.recommenders                     # Eclipse workspace stuff
		
		COMP353-OpenAccessMedicalCenter   # This git repo
		
		documentation					  # Play framework stuff
		framework                         # Play framework stuff
		repository                        # Play framework stuff
		samples                           # Play framework stuff
		play                              # Play framework stuff
		play.bat                          # Play framework stuff
		README.md                         # Play framework stuff

This layout came from just extracting `Play-2.0.8.zip` contents into the eclipse workspace.

Perhaps it's a weird setup, but since this is the only project in the workspace it was the easiest thing (on Windoze at least). Feel free to change it to something more sane / better :P
